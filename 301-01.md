Responive web design involves creating pages that can be accessed on devices with various screen sizes. If current trends continue mobile usage will surpass desktop usage. Three main components: flexible layouts, media queries, and flexible media. Use of fixed measurement units, such as pixels or inches, not advocated because iewport height and width continually change from device to device. Target ÷ context = result. Flexible grid formula can take all of fixed units of length and turn them into relative units.

Media queries provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances, the width of the viewport or device orientation for example. It is recommend to use the @media rule inside of an existing style sheet to avoid any additional HTTP requests. There are three different logical operators available for use within media queries, including and, not, and only. Media features identify what attributes or properties will be targeted within the media query expression. The orientation media feature determines if a device is in the landscape or portrait orientation. The min and max prefixes are available to use with the different aspect ratio features, identifying a ratio above or below that of which is stated.

### Design mobile first!

One quick way to make media scalable is by using the max-width property with a value of 100%. The max-width property doesn’t work well for all instances of media, specifically around iframes and embedded media but there is a work around.

Floated elements remain a part of the flow of the web page. Absolutely positioned page elements will not affect the position of other elements and other elements will not affect them, whether they touch each other or not.  Four valid values for the float property: left, right, none, inherit. An element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float.  If this parent element contained nothing but floated elements, the height of it would literally collapse to nothing. We fix it by clearing the float after the floated elements in the container but before the close of the container.
